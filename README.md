# Bamazon

This application is an Amazon-like storefront which allows customers, managers and supervisors different options.  This application utilizes the following npm packages:  mysql, inquirer and cli-table.

Customers are given the option to purchase an item. They are first shown a table with all of the options they can purchase. They are asked to input which item they would like (by item_id) and the quantity they would like to purchase.

If there is not enough inventory for the purchase the customer would like to make, they are unable to make the purchase and they receive a message letting them know.
